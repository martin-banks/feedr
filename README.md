		# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Unit Project #2: Feedr

		For our Unit 2 project we will build __Feedr__, a personalized feed reader. Our
		feed reader will pull feeds from our favorite blogs, allowing the user to switch
		between feeds and select articles to read.

		## Overview

		### Introduction

		The web is an ever growing medium and it is getting more and more difficult to
		filter useful information. In our journey to writing beautiful JavaScript we
		have come and will come across a great many reference points that will guide our
		learning. This is where personal feeds come in very useful. Online feeds are
		like to-do lists in that they can be infinitely personalized and there is not
		one solution that works for everybody.

		### Functionality

		In our _Feedr_ app, the user will be able to filter between publications through
		a dropdown on the header menu. Clicking/tapping on one of the articles will load
		a pop up with more information. The user from that point will be able to either
		dismiss the additional information or go to the referenced article.

		This will be our first single page app. All of our application views will be
		contained in the single [index.html](index.html) file. Our task, after we pull
		from the respective feed APIs, will be to render the appropriate HTML and
		content for the current state of the application.

		---

		## Technical Requirements

		### Your core application rules:

		**Feed sources:**

		Give the user the ability to pull from a multiple news sources. Here are a
		couple news sources to get you started.

		- [Mashable: http://mashable.com/stories.json](http://mashable.com/stories.json)
		- [Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/top.json](https://www.reddit.com/top.json)

		You should also feel free to use other news APIs.

		**Feedr rules:**

		- When the application first loads display the loading state. The loading state
			should also be shown whenever an asynchronous function (such as a `.fetch()`)
			is executing and the user is waiting.
		- When you successfully retrieve information from an API, swap from the loading
			state to a state showing an article list from the feed. The DOM structure of
			each article should adhere to the `.article` structure example.
		- When the user selects an article's title, show the `#pop-up` overlay with more
			details on that article (such as a link to read more at the original source,
			and a preview of the article).
		- All content of your application should be shown within the `.container` class.
		- Add an error message (either alert or a notification on the page) if the app
			cannot load from the selected feed.

		**Additional UI interaction rules:**

		- Add functionality to hide the pop-up when user selects the "X" button on the
			pop-up.
		- Clicking/tapping the "Feedr" logo will display the main/default feed.


		#### Alternate APIs

		If you use your own feeds, they must have APIs with the following minimum
		requirements. Feeds should;

		- Provide images for articles. When no image is available, you should use a
			default _placeholder_ image.
		- Provide either a category, tag, or custom taxonomy to display below the title
			(of course title of article is also required).
		- Provide a point, ranking, or some type of total impressions for the respective
			article.
		- Provide either a full version or a summary of the article for the pop up
			screen.

		#### CORS & APIs

		Keep in mind, if an API doesn't support CORS, your request will result in a CORS
		restriction error such as _"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
		present..."_ in the browser. To get around this, you can use the following proxy
		server to filter your API requests.

		Let's say you wanted to use the Reddit API, which has the following endpoint:

		`https://www.reddit.com/top.json`

		If you preface the request with the proxy server API as follows...

		```
		https://crossorigin.me/https://www.reddit.com/top.json
		```

		...you should be able to use the Reddit API without encountering a cross-domain
		restriction error. Here's a code example of how you might use the proxy server:

		_Note: The Reddit API doesn't need this extra proxy step, it is merely used here
		for demonstrative purposes._

		```js
		fetch('https://crossorigin.me/https://www.reddit.com/top.json')
			.then((response) => {
				return response.json()
			}).then((result) => {
				result.data.children.forEach((item) => {
					console.log(item.title)
				})
			})
		```


		#### Bonus Tasks

		These tasks are not required, but add extra functionality to your app which a
		user may desire, and also extend your knowledge of JavaScript;

		1. Merge all feeds into one main feed in chronological order for the initial
			 view. When the user clicks/taps the "Feedr" logo at the top, they should be
			 return to this feed. This will be the new "home view."
		2. Filter articles by title according to user keyboard input on the search input
			 box. This should run the filter on every keystroke. When the input box is
			 cleared, all articles should display in the respective feed.
		3. Add infinite scrolling. Start displaying only the first 20 articles and keep
			 loading more on user scrolling.

		## Getting Started

		Begin by "forking" this starter code repository. You can do so by clicking the
		"Fork" icon on the top right of [this
		page](https://github.com/jesstelford/feedr). Once complete, clone the repository
		to your computer by running the following commands:

		```
		git clone https://github.com/<your-username-here>/feedr.git
		cd feedr
		```

		The `feedr` directory now contains a copy of this repository.

		As you accomplish a feature, be sure to commit it to Git and push to GitHub.

		### Pro Tips

		- Take it one bit at a time. Start with the loading state, then see if you can
			switch to a temporary fake article list state.
		- Map out all of the needed fields/properties from each respective feed.
			- Try out the [JSON View chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)
		- Start by doing a console.log of the incoming feeds to confirm you have a
			successful transaction before you start mapping anything out.
		- Think about ways to best standardize all of your incoming data.
		- Test small pieces of functionality frequently, to make sure everything is
			working.
		- Focus on keeping your state and views separated; your code will be much easier
			to maintain as the applicaiton becomes more complex.
		- Use tools such as Stack Overflow, Google and documentation resources to solve
			problems.

		## Necessary Deliverables

		* A __working Feedr, built by you__, that can be run locally
		* A __new git repository hosted on Github__, where your codebase is maintained.
			- Most of your work will be done in the `main.js` file. You may update the
				`index.html` and `style.css` files if you would like to further customize
				your app.
		* A __`README.md` file__ describing your application and the functionality it
			contains.

		### Due Date

		Wednesday July 13th before class starts (at 6pm).

		## Project Feedback + Evaluation

		Students will fork the "feedr" application and commit their code as they
		complete pieces of functionality.

		The instructional team will grade each technical requirement and provide a
		numeric grade on a scale.

		- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the
			technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build
			something that was reasonably complex?
		- **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your
			project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not
			just a hello world response)?
		- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices
			covered in class, such modularity and semantic naming? Did you comment your
			code as your instructors have in class?
		- **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project.

		Each category is scored according to the below, where a `1` is a _pass_.

		Score | Expectations
		----- | ------------
		**0** | _Does not meet expectations._
		**1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
		**2** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

		The total will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project
		goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which
		can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
